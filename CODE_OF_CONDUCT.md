# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in JargoNaut a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful and kind to others
* Welcoming newcomers and helping them get started
* Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Being patient with those who are learning

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Harassment, trolling, or insulting comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Learning Environment

JargoNaut is specifically a **learning project**. This means:

* **Questions are encouraged** - There are no "stupid questions"
* **Mistakes are learning opportunities** - We all make them
* **Beginners are welcome** - Everyone was a beginner once
* **Experimentation is valued** - Try things, break things, learn things
* **Growth is celebrated** - Progress matters more than perfection

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (GitHub repository, discussions, issues, pull requests) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainer directly via GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, with modifications specific to JargoNaut's learning-focused environment.
